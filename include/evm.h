/// EVM-C -- C interface to Ethereum Virtual Machine
///
/// ## High level design rules
/// 1. Pass function arguments and results by value.
///    This rule comes from modern C++ and tries to avoid costly alias analysis
///    needed for optimization. As the result we have a lots of complex structs
///    and unions. And variable sized arrays of bytes cannot be passed by copy.
/// 2. The EVM operates on integers so it prefers values to be host-endian.
///    On the other hand, LLVM can generate good code for byte swaping.
///    The interface also tries to match host application "natural" endianess.
///    I would like to know what endianess you use and where.
